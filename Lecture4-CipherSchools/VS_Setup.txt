Created a script file named test and created a empty game object
Connected the empty object with the test script


CODE:

using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class Test : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        Debug.Log("Hey Fellas, Shashank Here!");   
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {

}
